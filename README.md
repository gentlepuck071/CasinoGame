# Welcome to **Open Source Casino**!

> A place where you can enjoy playing casino games with donuts (_fake money_)!

**I strongly recommend that you never play in a casino with real money!**

To start playing any gamemode simply navigate to the [website](https://lucashazardous.github.io/OpenSourceCasino), choose game and have fun!

### This doesn't make any sense

Why would you want to play if you know that the rewards are fake? I'm aware of that, this casino will never give the excitement caused by chasing meaningful rewards. That is not the goal though and will never be. The only excitement that you can get here is the one caused by satysfiying, easy and intuitive gameplay. It also gives you an insight why you **should never think of a casino as a way to make money**.

### My donuts are gone, what now?

There is a certain trick to get them back. Amount of your donuts is stored in local storage in your browser. So to get them back you can either:

- head over to the developer console in your browser and in **Application** tab, under **Local Storage** section select the website url and modify the **points** value
- clear your browser data to get the default amount of donuts
